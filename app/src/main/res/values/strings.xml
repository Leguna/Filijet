    <string name="isi_cerita">Ever since I was little, I just kept staring at the monitor. Playing games has also become a hobby. However, this hobby did not last long, in the end I decided to make a game.\n\nIt was at this time that I began to learn the basics of programming. Because of 4 years of experience in making games, lectures feel more comfortable to run.\n\nMaking games and programs has their difficulties, especially with so few team members. Lack of experience is always one of the challenges when starting a project.\n\nResolving many problems and difficulties is one of the tasks of the programmer. To achieve my dreams, I will continue to fight in the field of application programming and games. I hope all who read this have the same or more determination than me.\n\nThank you.\n</string>
